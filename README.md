# Lasso-Regression
Unique Contribution

The adaptive_lasso function applies Lasso regression with feature importance weights by multiplying each feature by its importance score. This way, important features are less penalized by the regularization term, allowing the algorithm to adapt to the importance of each feature.

By incorporating feature importance into Lasso regression, it becomes possible to create a unique contribution that is particularly useful in scenarios where some features are more critical than others, such as in medical diagnosis or financial modeling.
